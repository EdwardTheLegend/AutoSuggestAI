It costs money, but not that much so make sure you set a suitable budget (like $1 / month) and you will be fine.

## Usage

Once installed, the AutoSuggestAI plugin will automatically start suggesting words as you type in paragraphs in the block editor, nowhere else. These suggestions are powered by AI, making them highly accurate and contextually relevant.

Suggested words appear in grey and are not actually part of the post until you press tab.  If you press anything else then the grey suggested words disappear.
